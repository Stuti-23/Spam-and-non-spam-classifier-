# Spam-and-non-spam-classifier-
It is a classifier that I have made to check whether the mail is spam or not. To preprocess the data, I used a natural language processing tool, and for the model, I used a naive machine learning algorithm. To deploy the model in the form of a website, I have used Streamlit.
